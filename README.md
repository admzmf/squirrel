Squirrelizer 1.0.0 || 💃🎶 -> 🐿🎶
------------------------------
The **Squirrelizer** queries the last.fm music database for information on songs related to the keyword 'Girl' and prints the titles of the results of the search, where the string 'Girl' has been replaced by 'Squirrel'.

Additional information:
- This is a mini-project that I wrote to learn more about RESTful APIs
- I chose to use the last.fm database because it seems to have good data on tracks compared to other music databases and a pretty simple, straightforward API.
